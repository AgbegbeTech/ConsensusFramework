# ConsensusFramework
Open-source blockchain framework designed to dynamically adapt its consensus mechanism based on network conditions, transaction volumes, security requirements, and energy efficiency.

Consensus Framework (CF)

# Introduction

The Consensus Framework (CFF) is an innovative, open-source blockchain framework designed to dynamically adapt its consensus mechanism based on network conditions, transaction volumes, security requirements, and energy efficiency. CFF aims to integrate the strengths of various consensus mechanisms into a single, unified system, providing a flexible, scalable, and efficient blockchain solution.
  
# Project Objectives

  ∙ To explore and integrate multiple consensus mechanisms within a singular framework.
  ∙ To enable dynamic selection of consensus mechanisms based on predefined criteria.
  ∙ To provide a modular, extensible architecture that encourages community-driven enhancements and innovations.
  ∙ To foster an inclusive and collaborative environment for developers and researchers interested in blockchain technology and its applications.

# Framework Overview

CF is built with modularity and flexibility in mind, allowing for seamless integration and switching between different consensus mechanisms, including but not limited to:

  ∙ Proof of Work (PoW)
  ∙ Proof of Stake (PoS)
  ∙ Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
  ∙ Proof of Authority (PoA)
  ∙ Proof of Space (PoSpace)
  ∙ ...and more

The framework is designed to be blockchain-agnostic, supporting various blockchain technologies and applications through a plug-and-play consensus module system.

# Architecture

The CFF architecture consists of several key components:

∙ Consensus Module Interface: A generic interface for consensus modules, allowing for easy integration and interchangeability of consensus mechanisms.
∙ Dynamic Consensus Selector: A component that evaluates network conditions and selects the most appropriate consensus mechanism based on predefined criteria.
∙ Blockchain Core: The backbone of the framework, responsible for managing the blockchain data structure, transactions, and state.
∙ Networking Layer: Utilizes libp2p for decentralized, peer-to-peer network communication.
∙ Storage Module: Integrates with IPFS for decentralized storage solutions, enhancing scalability and efficiency.


# Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Node.js (version X or higher)
npm (version X or higher)
Docker (for containerization and IPFS integration)
Minikube (for local Kubernetes deployment)


### Installation

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ConsensusFusionFramework.git
    cd ConsensusFusionFramework
      npm install

### Running the Framework
    npm start
    
### Deploying with Minikube

    minikube start
    kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
